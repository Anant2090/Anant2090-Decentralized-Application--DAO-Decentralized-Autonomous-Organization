# Anant2090-Decentralized-Application--DAO-Decentralized-Autonomous-Organization
Created a DApp for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on Ethereum. Investors can contribute funds, vote on proposals, and manage shares, fostering transparent and collaborative decision-making.
# DAO Project

Welcome to the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) project! This project aims to implement a decentralized governance system with features such as contribution, proposal creation, voting, and execution.

## Overview

The DAO project uses Solidity for smart contract development, enabling decentralized decision-making and fund management. Users can contribute funds, create proposals, vote on proposals, and execute them based on community consensus.

## Features

- **Contribution:**
  Users can contribute funds to the DAO, receiving shares in return. The total number of shares represents voting power.

- **Proposal Creation:**
  DAO members can create proposals for various actions, such as fund transfers or smart contract executions.

- **Voting:**
  Members can vote on proposals using their shares. Proposals require a certain percentage of votes to be executed.

- **Execution:**
  Proposals meeting the required quorum can be executed, leading to fund transfers or other specified actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** Smart contract development language.
- **Truffle:** Development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum.
- **Web3.js:** Ethereum JavaScript API for interacting with the smart contract.
- **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **FastAPI:** Backend framework for managing DAO operations.
